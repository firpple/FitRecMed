#Medical/Pharmaceutical regression fitting program
This is for use at the University of Nevada, Reno Pharmaceutical Department

##Details/features
This program takes the V vs ATP data set and produces a K-ad vs L heat map.
In other words, this program is pretty much the same as the other Rsquared heat map program except that this program uses the V vs ATP dataset instead of the N vs V data set.

##Instructions for installation
1. Drag the zip folder into the Linux environment
   a. Make sure the Linux environment has scipy and lmfit
   b. Basically drag the zip to one of the Linux VMs that I installed.
2.  Unzip the folder
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder
4. Use this command
  $ python RsquaredATPV.py 
  $ #do not include the '$'
5. Run this program like you would with the other R squared heat map
